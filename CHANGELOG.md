# Changelog

## v2.3.5
- Hardened `gitmap update` PATH sync with retry + rename fallback, and it now exits with failure if active PATH binary remains stale.
- Clarified update output labels to distinguish source version (`constants.go`) vs active executable version.
- Added same rename-fallback PATH sync behavior in `run.ps1`.

## v2.3.4
- Updated PATH-binary sync in `run.ps1` and `gitmap update` to use retry-on-lock behavior (20 attempts × 500ms), matching the self-update spec.
- Added explicit recovery guidance when active PATH binary is still locked, including an exact `Copy-Item` fix command.

## v2.3.3
- Added `gitmap doctor` command: reports PATH binary, deployed binary, version mismatches, git/go availability, and recommends exact fix commands.

## v2.3.2
- `gitmap update` now syncs the active PATH binary with the deployed binary, so commands like `release` are available immediately.
- `gitmap update` now prints changelog bullet points after update (or no-op update) for quick visibility.
- Added `gitmap changelog --open` and `gitmap changelog.md` to open `CHANGELOG.md` in the default app.

## v2.3.1
- Added `gitmap changelog` command for concise, CLI-friendly release notes.
- Improved `gitmap update` output to show deployed binary/version and warn if PATH points to another binary.
- `gitmap update` now prints latest changelog notes after a successful update.

## v2.3.0
- Added `gitmap release-pending` (`rp`) to release all `release/v*` branches missing tags.
- `gitmap release` and `gitmap release-branch` now switch back to the previous branch after completion.

## v2.2.3
- Fixed PowerShell parser-breaking characters in update/deploy output paths.
- Improved deployment rollback messaging in `run.ps1`.

## v2.2.2
- Added additional parser safety fixes for update script output.

## v2.2.1
- Patched PowerShell parsing edge cases affecting update flow.
